# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This is a showcase of my work in analytics, product development, and web development. The website is built from scratch using GitHub Pages and includes several advanced features such as dark mode, a scroll progress bar, and a lightbox for portfolio images.

## Features

- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Users can switch between light and dark themes for better accessibility and comfort.
- **Smooth Scroll Progress Bar**: A dynamic progress bar tracks the user's scroll position on the page.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is mobile-friendly and adjusts to various screen sizes.
- **Lightbox Gallery**: Portfolio images can be viewed in full size with next/previous navigation.
- **Form Validation with reCAPTCHA**: The contact form is protected with Google reCAPTCHA to prevent spam.
- **Lazy Loading**: Images load only when they are about to be viewed, improving page load times.
- **Local Storage**: The contact form remembers input data in case of accidental page reload.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6)**
- **AOS.js** (Animate on Scroll)
